For this project, I created two projects in different programming languages. The first project: Bank Management System is written in C++ and describes the simple procedure of a real-life banking
system where a customer can view their account, make transactions and change requests. The second project: Chatbot is written in Java. It describes a virtual experience of a user interacting with
AI. The user can say hi and it responds back.
